                                good name for his services that were also internationally recognized. He served as the chairman
                                of the board for the center of Islamic studies of the Oxford university and as a visiting

                        message of humanity. What Moulana said about quarter of a century ago has become more relevant today
                        in the context of rising aggressive behavior of some violent groups and organizations for which innocent
